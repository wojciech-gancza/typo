    <h1><a href="typo.html">TYPO</a> programmer reference manual</h1>
      (c) WGan 2021 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">[licence: MIT]</a>
    <p>
      Additionally to typo <a href="typo.html">overview</a>, which is always 
      good to start with, and <a href="user_reference_manual.html">user 
      reference manual</a>, which is 'must know-how' (because programmers must 
      understand user point of view), it is good to know source code (I think 
      you already take a look) and most wanted part of documentation -  
      <a href="class_reference_manual.html">class reference manual</a> describing 
      all functions and classes functionality. 
      But before, some overview from programmer point of view:
    
    <h2>Typo is primitive</h2>
      Typo is not a well-suited enterprice metaprogramming system. maybe, 
      some day, it would, but for sure not this version. It is primitive, because
      it has single responsibility: generation od source code. Reading of source 
      knowledge about source code files which are automatically generated. All
      the businnes logic of the metaprogram - is out of its scope. 
      Use it as primitove output, preparing its data and allowing to select 
      templates and modules with generators. All the rest - is in your hands.
      Using typo - you can focus on metalogic of your domain.
    <p>
      Typo is as it is, but its license allow you to modify the code. I tried to 
      write it as clean as I could, so, I hope understanding the code should 
      not be so painfull, however it is good to read reference manual and use 
      it as a guide to the code. 
    <p>
      I put many classes to only few code files. It might not be handy, when 
      modifying typo code. But when you want to use it as library in your own
      metaprogramming project, you need just copy this few files into your
      python code. This is why all the files have prefix <i>typo_</i> - to 
      locate them together in a directory list. List which may contain 
      many more files.
    
    <h2>Single interface</h2>
      In your metaprograms you can use all classes of typo, however, the 
      interface of typo functionality is located in single class <i>typo_processor</i>
      located in file typo_interpreter.py. To import it into your project, use:
    <p class="example">
      from typo_interpreter import typo_processor
    <p>
      Configuration of generation and passing parameters to templates is made be
      setting values in generator context. It is not handy. Feel free to prepare
      adapter with interface specific to your domain and your code manners. 
      Writing adapters to third party code is always good practice.
    <p>
      Class <i>typo_processor</i> have only 3 methods:
      <ul>
        <li><b>set_value(name, value)</b> - sets the value in typo context. 
          Value can be any python value or python expression. When it is proper
          Python expression - it is interpreted by Python interpreter when 
          it is set. Strings and lists of strings can contain placeholders.
          Placeholders are replaces by their values when the value us read. 
          The functionality is directly used when assinging value to context 
          variable </li>
        <li><b>import_generator(module_name)</b> - adds module to modules 
          considered when looking for code generator mentioned in template.</li>
        <li><b>generate(template_name)</b> - generate output file based on
          template passed as parameter. Template name should not have suffix 
          <i>.template</i></li>. This suffix, as well as template path is 
          added by typo.
      </ul>
