  <h2>up to 2021-11-30</h2>
    Starting probject blog. Project is at the last stage of stablisation of first 
    release, but up to now, I had no idea that such blog could be handy. Now, I think
    I can write here all the toughts about the project, reasons why it is made 
    in such manner, and also not some of the experiences with desing and programming.
  <p>
    Lets start from a retrospective.
  <p>
    Project was started as third approach to generation of classes source code,
    when I realized, that is is easier to base on user defined file templates 
    instead of building whole file by the code. First two approaches was abadoned,
    because I was stuck in the code with wery poor results. First two approaches
    was made in TDD, and I found that it could be a problem. Focussing on tests,
    I was loosing the overall sight, and the project start to be chimeric.
  <p>
    If not TDD then what? For many years, working as a programmer, I found that 
    TDD is not the best, It is just better then having no tests. But on the other hand - TDD
    need specification and when specification is not yet prepared - it is better 
    to work with spikes - just write the code and check what it form.
  <p>
    Such method is usually used by newbies, but it lead to fast development and pretty
    nice results. So maybe it is not wrong, when it is enriched by some additional work
    on stabilization. And this project is a test of such idea. 
  <p>
    In git repository, you can find two phases of each release:
  <ul>
    <li><b>development</b> - phase when functionality is prepared.</li>
    <li><b>stablisation</b> - time for adding unit test, fixes, reorderting the code,
     writing documentation and do all the things which are necessary but boring</li>
    </ul>
    Stablization phase is also good time to think about new features you want to 
    have in next release. When stable, tested version is released, all these 
    ideas could be passed to development.
  <p>
    Development/stabilization can overlap, if you have enough power team. For single
    person development it could be eventually performed on different branches.
  <p>
    Two phase approach can be relized in scrum. Stabilization tasks are also 
    productive adding documentation and removing bugs.
