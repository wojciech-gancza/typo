    First version is ready. Next version will contain possibility to write 
    scripts which could be run in the same way as current generation of output file
    - by its name. Scripts will be stored in special directory pinted by the context variable.
  <p>
    It seems that stabilization is good time for planning new features...
  
  <h2>up to 2021-11-30</h2>
    Starting project blog. Project is at the last stage of stabilization of first 
    release, but up to now, I had no idea that such blog could be handy. Now, I think
    I can write here all the thoughts about the project, reasons why it is made 
    in such manner, and also not some of the experiences with design and programming.
  <p>
    Let's start from a retrospective.
  <p>
    Project was started as third approach to generation of classes source code,
    when I realized, that it is easier to base on user defined file templates 
    instead of building whole file by the code. First two approaches was abandoned,
    because I was stuck in the code with very poor results. First two approaches
    was made in TDD, and I found that it could be a problem. Focusing on tests,
    I was losing the overall sight, and the project start to be chimeric.
  <p>
    If not TDD then what? For many years, working as a programmer, I found that 
    TDD is not the best, It is just better than having no tests. But on the other hand - TDD
    need specification and when specification is not yet prepared - it is better 
    to work with spikes - just write the code and check what it form.
  <p>
    Such method is usually used by newbies, but it lead to fast development and pretty
    nice results. So maybe it is not wrong, when it is enriched by some additional work
    on stabilization. And this project is a test of such idea. 
  <p>
    In git repository, you can find two phases of each release:
  <ul>
    <li><b>development</b> - phase when functionality is prepared.</li>
    <li><b>stablization</b> - time for adding unit test, fixes, reordering the code,
     writing documentation and do all the things which are necessary but boring</li>
    </ul>
    Stabilization phase is also good time to think about new features you want to 
    have in next release. When stable, tested version is released, all these 
    ideas could be passed to development.
  <p>
    Development/stabilization can overlap, if you have enough power team. For single
    person development it could be eventually performed on different branches.
  <p>
    Two phase approach can be realized in scrum. Stabilization tasks are also 
    productive adding documentation and removing bugs.
