    <h1>TYPO</h1>
      (c) WGan 2021 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">[licence: MIT]</a>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
      TYPO.py is a simple program generating source files which can be used in your
      own projects. 
    <p>
      Source files are created from templates. Templates can contain placeholders 
      in a form of <i>${placeholder_name}</i>. When file is generated, 
      placeholders are filled by program written in Python. Python code can read and 
      interpret values set by TYPO interpreter.
    <p>
      Typo is:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#easy_to_use">Easy to use</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="#extendable">Extendable</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="#keep_user_code">Keep user code</a></li>
    </ul>  
  
    <h2><a name="easy_to_use">Easy to use</a></h2>
      To use TYPO, you need to create template containing set of placeholders.
      Tou can take any of your typical file, and change some of its content
      to placeholders. Then you need to run TYPO and generate subsequent
      files by setting placeholder values and running generation by typing 
      template name. So you have two types of orders:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>assignment</b> - order is in the form <i>name=value</i>, where name 
          is any string identifier and value can contain placeholders which will 
          be evaluated at the moment of using this value. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>generator</b> - order is in the form <i>generator</i>, and runs 
          generation of the output file based on template named 
          <i>generator.template</i>. When generation is started, some values 
          need to be defined:
          <ul>
            <li><i>path</i> - path where the output file will be located</li>
            <li><i>file_name</i> - full name of the file</li>
            <li><i>template_path</i> - path to the folder with templates</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      You can also store list of TYPO commands in the file and use it as 
      a parameter when starting TYPO.
    <p>
      Placeholders can be filled by the assigned values, but more powerfull is
      runnging python code instead. When placeholder is found in the template, 
      TYPO checks if Python class named <i>gen_placeholder_name</i>. If it exist,
      it is created and its method <i>generate</i> is called. TYPO passes
      to the function repository of all assigned values and the output object
      allowing writing into the file. This writing object also keeps proper 
      indentation og generated code.
    
    <h2><a name="extendable">Extendable</a></h2>
      Programmer using TYPO can crate not only its own templates, but also 
      your own code generators. It is even possible to build your own sowtware
      which will use TYPO as its output. More detais you can find in TYPO
      <a href="user_reference_manual.html">user reference manual</a>
    <p>
      You can not only run TYPO as standalone program, but also as a library
      for your metaprograms. Just take alook at TYPO 
      <a href="programmer_reference_manual.html">programmer reference 
      manual.</a>
    
    <h2><a name="keep_user_code">Keep user code</a></h2>
      It is not recommended to mix generated code with code written by the 
      programmer, however sometimes it might be handy. 
    <p>
      User code can be placed in generated files in places specified by the 
      template. When creating templates, you can locate placeholder 
      <i>${user_code}</i> in any place of the template. It will be 
      replaced by the code read from the modified code. User code placeholder 
      muse be the only one element in the line of template file. Its indentation
      have no result in copied code, which is moved 'as it is'.
    <p>
      User code placeholder must be surrounded by constant lines easy to 
      distinguish from other lines. Usually - such lines should be comments
      informing about user code placement possibility.
