# First test of typo. Generate one output file containing user code.

# Path to directory with output files templates. This path is used when typo
# is looking for template to generate file. This path can be changed at any time
# but it is handy to initialize it with usually used location

# Path to output files. Also could be changed by the script, but by default 
# output files will be placed here.
